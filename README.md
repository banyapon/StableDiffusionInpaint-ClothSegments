# StableDiffusionInpaint-ClothSegments
This project explores the application of cloth segmentation to inpainting, allowing for modification or removal of objects from clothing images using Stable Diffusion Inpainting and a RunwayML model.

# Key Points
## Pre-trained Model:
This code leverages a pre-trained model, which means you don't need to train the model from scratch. You can immediately use it for inference (making predictions).
## Image Segmentation: 
The primary goal is to identify and segment different clothing items within an image.
## Custom Library: 
The functions from iglovikov_helper_functions seem to be part of a custom or external library designed to simplify common tasks in deep learning projects.
